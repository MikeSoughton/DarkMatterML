TODO:

- generalise the array unpacking in the pandas plotter (beyond the 1d hist)
- Factorise run.py into useful functions when they become clear

Possibilities:

- With root numpy can read in files instead of trees, although this messes up
  the lorentzvector reading part
- move to root_pandas instead of root_numpy 
- make the feature importances plotter use the ML data class
- the mlData takes one set of variables, could allow it to choose subsets
  instead

NOTE:

- For now NaNs are set to 0 for compatibility with ML libraries, may want to
  revise this later
