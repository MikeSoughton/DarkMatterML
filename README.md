-----------------

The paper implements a new machine learning technique to distinguish between signals of Dark Matter (DM) candidates through monojet and dijet LHC searches. Events are generated through [`MadGraph`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0522) along with [`Pythia`](https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3820) and [`Delphes`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6346).
