Repository for the code associated with the paper 'Using Machine Learning to disentangle LHC signatures of Dark Matter candidates', [arXiv:1910.06058](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06058) (2019). Authors: Charanjit K. Khosa, Veronica Sanz and Michael Soughton.

## Overview

Looking for evidence of Dark Matter is of great importance to the state of High Energy Physics (HEP). Mono-X searches within particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are one area where potential Dark Matter particles may be discovered. Our paper explores 

Events are generated through [`MadGraph`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0522) along with [`Pythia`](https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3820) and [`Delphes`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6346) for showering and detector effects.
